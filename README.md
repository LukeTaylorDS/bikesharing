# Bikesharing

## Overview
This project aims to create data visualizations from NYC Citi Bike data in Tableau to show that the bike-sharing business can be viable in other locales.

1. This dashboard(seen below) shows that many people would rather bike in densely packed urban areas rather than drive. 

The heaviest usage of bike-sharing can be seen at standard commute hours on weekdays, which we can assume is due to traffic making driving unbearable. The appeal of bike-sharing is undeniable when one sits in traffic watching bikes fly by right next to you.

1. The second dashboard(seen below) shows that most trips are under 20 minutes and that there is a disparity between male and female user volume.  

Short trips are very common because people choose to bike a few blocks rather than walk or even drive. Driving can be a hassle in the city due to having to find parking and the constant traffic. 

There are many reasons why bike-sharing is more appealing to men than women like the outfits men wear compared to women are more acceptable when riding a bike. Research should be done to determine why women don't use bike-sharing as much, which may lead to figuring out how to market and cater to women.

## Summary

The bike-sharing business looks viable in almost any high-traffic urban area. Bike-sharing solves most city people's dilemma of choosing between walking and driving. CitiBike allows people who live in Manhattan to be less dependent on cars, possibly from even having to own a car. Not only can bike-sharing be more financially responsible for many people, but daily exercise will also be a massive draw. You might ask, "Why not just buy a bike instead of renting" and the answer is convenience. Bike-sharing allows people not to worry about maintenance, storage, or the upfront cost of a quality bike. The bike-sharing business can be replicated in any urban area.
