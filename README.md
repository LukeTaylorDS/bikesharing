# Bikesharing

## Overview
This project aims to create data visualizations from NYC Citi Bike data in Tableau to show that the bike-sharing business can be viable in other locales.

1. This dashboard(seen below) shows that a lot of people would rather bike in densely packed urban areas rather than drive. 

The most heavy usage of bikesharing can be seen at common commute hours on the weekdays, which we can assume is due to traffic making driving unbearable. The appeal of bikesharing is very obvious when one is sitting in traffic watching bikes fly by right next to you.

1. The second dashboard(seen below) shows that most trips are under 20 minutes and disparity between male and female user volume. 

Short trips seem very common, which is probable due to people choosing to bike a couple blocks rather than walk or even drive. Driving can be a huge hassel in the city due to having to find parking and the constant traffic. 

There are many reasons why bikesharing might be more appealing to men than to women, like maybe the outfits men wear compared to women are more acceptable when riding a bike. More research should be done in order to figure why women dont use bikesharing as much, which can maybe lead into figuring out how to market and cater to women.

## Summary

The bike-sharing buisness looks viable in almost any high traffic urban area. Bike-sharing solves the dillema most city people have, choosing between walking and driving. CitiBike allows people who live in Manhattan to be less dependent on cars, possibly from even having to own a car. Not only can bike-sharing be more financially responsible for a lot of people, the daily excercise will be a massive draw as well. You might ask, "Why not just buy a bike instead of renting", and the answer to that is, convenience. Bike-sharing allows for people not to worry about maitnence, storage, or the upfront cost of a quality bike. The bike-sharing buisness looks like it can be replicated in any urban area.
